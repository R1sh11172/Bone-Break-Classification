# Bone-Break-Classification

### Project Description
I developed a robust bone break classification system employing PyTorch and state-of-the-art EfficientNet/VisionTransformer models to accurately identify 10 distinct types of fractures. Utilizing advanced computer vision and machine learning techniques, the system analyzed a dataset of over 1120 medical images. To enhance accessibility, I implemented a user-friendly interface using Gradio, facilitating seamless input for efficient bone break identification for deployment on HugginFace. This integrated approach not only showcased the application of cutting-edge models for accurate classification but also prioritized user experience through a streamlined interface, contributing to the advancement of medical imaging applications in the field of fracture analysis.

### Technologies Used
- PyTorch
- Python
- Gradio

### Why did I build it?
I initiated the project with a focus on creating a practical solution for healthcare. Motivated by the desire to create a project useful for this field, I developed the bone break classification system to serve as a valuable tool to detect the specific type of fracture that occurred.
