# Bone-Break-Classification

### Project Description
I developed a robust bone break classification system employing PyTorch and state-of-the-art EfficientNet/VisionTransformer models to accurately identify 10 distinct types of fractures. Utilizing computer vision and machine learning models and techniques, the system analyzed a dataset of over 1120 medical images to classify fractures. Additionally, I implemented a user-friendly interface using Gradio to allow for simple user input, allowing the user to upload images and see the predicted bone break. 

### Technologies Used
- PyTorch
- Python
- Gradio

### Why did I build it?
I initiated the project with a focus on creating a practical solution for healthcare. Motivated by the desire to create a project useful for this field, I developed the bone break classification system to serve as a valuable tool to detect the specific type of fracture in any image that the user uploads.
